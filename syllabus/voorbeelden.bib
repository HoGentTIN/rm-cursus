  abstract     = {High quality computing services with reduced cost and improved performance have made cloud computing a popular paradigm. Due to its flexible infrastructure, net centric approach and ease of access, the cloud computing has become prevalent. Its widespread usage is however being diminished by the fact that the cloud computing paradigm is yet unable to address security issues which may in turn aggravate the quality of service as well as the privacy of customers' data.

In this paper, we present a survey of security issues in terms of security threats and their remediations. The contribution aims at the analysis and categorization of working mechanisms of the main security issues and the possible solutions that exist in the literature. We perform a parametric comparison of the threats being faced by cloud platforms. Moreover, we compare various intrusion detection and prevention frameworks being used to address security issues. The trusted cloud computing and mechanisms for regulating security compliance among cloud service providers are also analyzed. Since the security mechanisms continue to evolve, we also present the future orientation of cloud security issues and their possible countermeasures.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing is a pervasive computing paradigm that has revolutionized how computer infrastructure and services are delivered. Current research trends on cloud computing have been focused on the technology, applications, costs, benefits, and security of cloud computing at the organizational level within small and medium sized enterprises. Little research attention has been paid on adoption and usage of cloud computing at educational establishments and how contextual factors can influence diffusion and adoption of cloud computing. Universities in developing countries are faced with challenging socio-economic and political constraints that limit their ability to invest in expensive information systems to compete on the global stage. Using constructs from the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology acceptance model, this paper proposes a model that takes account of contextual, economic, and technological influences in the perception and adoption of cloud computing at universities in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from a pilot study, based on the model, through a survey of university lecturers and IS experts shows reliability and validity of the instrument and supports its usage for a more extensive study. Implications, potential contributions to research, and suggestions for future study are discussed.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a method based on Learning Automata to solve Hybrid Flexible Flowline Scheduling Problems (HFFSP) with additional constraints like sequence dependent setup times, precedence relations between jobs and machine eligibility. This category of production scheduling problems is noteworthy because it involves several types of constraints that occur in complex real-life production schedul- ing problems like those in process industry and batch production. In the proposed technique, Learning Automata play a dispersion game to determine the order of jobs to be processed so that makespan is minimized, while avoiding precedence constraint violations. Experiments on a set of benchmark problems indicate that this method can yield better results than the ones known until now.},

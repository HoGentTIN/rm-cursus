  abstract  = {To make the most informed decision when evaluating and selecting a Learning Management System, the business and technical requirements need to be properly prioritized. A very useful technique is to use a meaningful word set such as the MoSCoW method.

The meaning of the MoSCoW word set helps stakeholders understand what they are doing during prioritization in a way that other methods of prioritization do not.},

Different options for presenting uncertainty were investigated in a carefully designed user evaluation that was conducted on statistical analysts, policy makers and journalists ( N = 108). The study includes exploring several options for displaying interval estimates with and without point estimates in line and bar charts. We discuss the results for all options and derive presentation suggestions. Our study indicates that showing uncertainty improves the validity of user statements and that data without point estimates have different display},

CRAAP is an acronym that most students don’t expect a librarian to be using, let alone using to lead a class. Little do they know that librarians can be crude and/or rude, and do almost anything in order to penetrate their students’ deep memories and satisfy their instructional objectives. So what is CRAAP and how does it relate to libraries? Here begins a long story about a short acronym…},
